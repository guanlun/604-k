Please use the following command to compile:

kompile --transition "atomic lookup spawn increment" imp.k

Note that my version of atomic blocks includes a semicolon at the end of the block:

atomic {
    ...
};

However it would be trivial to change it.

In my implementation, atomicity is achieved by setting the atomic flag. I've also created an
"atomiclookup" cell to keep track of which thread is waiting for which atomic action to finish.

Please find more documentation in the comments of imp.k.
